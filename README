landscape.txt // a sample landscape file.
========================================
Before complie, make sure the landscape file and Sketchpad.jar are in the current directory.
Compile by typing:
make
run by typing one of follows or some other similar valid commands, otherwise it may causes error:
./lander -g 5 -f landscape.txt -t -5
./lander -g 5 -f landscape.txt -t -5 -i
Here -g represents gravity, causing acceleration towards the moon, -t represents the thrust, 
the acceleration created by the ships thrusters when they are on, and -f has one argument, 
the name of a text file containing points that represent the landscape.
If -i is typed, the program will also add some more additional improvements.
========================================
IMPROVEMENTS:
improvements with or without -i option:----------
    Perfect command line arg checking allowing command lines in any order and with and without spases between options and arguments;
    Preventing the ship from going outside the window from left or right edges, wrapping around the right and left edges after it disappears;
    Beautiful line segment colors instead of black;
improvements with the -i option:-----------------
    Print the time used(in seconds) in the terminal during the game;
    A graphical fuel gauge in sketchpad window(vertical bar which becomes less filled as ship runs out of fuel);
    A number shows the current amount of fuel in the terminal during the game;
========================================
This program is a game which let the user uses keyboard to control a ship to make it land on the surface of the moon.
The ship will keep falling due to the gravity set by -g option,when the left arrow and right arrow key are clicked, rotate the ship by 10 degrees each key click, 
The left arrow key rotates counter-clockwise, and the right arrow key clockwise. When the space bar is pressed, the ship will respond to the thrust set by the -t option.
(unless the current fuel amount is 0 if -i option was typed)
The goal is to land the ship (1) upright, (2) sufficiently slowly(vertical velocity less than 20), (3) on a perfectly flat surface, otherwise, it will crash.

I disscussed with Xiaocong Zhou, Lingbo Tang.
